gross domestic product GDP
the total market value of the goods and services producted in a country within a certain time period.
 measure of gdp
aggregate oupput
aggregate income
aggregate expenditure
aggregate output = aggregate income = aggregate expenditure

value of final output and sum of value added
receipts at each stage value added at each stage

nominal gdp 
	GDP measured by current prices
Real GDP 
	GDP measure by constant prices
GDP deflator GDP平减指数
	= (Nominal GDP/Real GDP)*100

wine 100 5 110 6
bread 1000 1 1200 1.5
real GDP = 110*5 + 1200*1
nomimal GDP = 110*6+1200*1.5
GDP deflater = nominal / real *100

GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)
C:consumer spending on final goods and services
I:gross private domestic investment(e.g.,plant and equipment) and changes in inventory(inventory investment)
G:government spending on final goods and services
X:exports
M:imports

national income
	= employees'wages and benefit 
	+ corporate and government profits pre-tax => direct tax
	+ interest income
	+ unincorporated business oweners' income 
	+ rent 
	+ indirect business taxes 间接税
	- subsidies


personal income
	= national income
	- indeirect business taxes
	- corporate income taxes
	- undistributed corporate profits = retained earning
	+ transfer payments
personal dispensable income 个人可支配收入
	= personal income = personal tax

aggregate demand

using the expenditure approach
GDP = C+I+G+(X-M)
using the income approach 
GDP = C+S+T
S: household and business savings
T: tax
C+I+G+(X-M) = C+S+T

S-I = (G-T)+(X-M)
G-T : fiscal balance
G-T >0 ,government deficit
G-T <0 , government surplus

X-M : net exports or trade balance
X-M >0 , trade surplus
X-M <0 , trade deficit

IS curve
aggregate income(AI) = Aggregate expenditure(AE)
S = I+(G-T)+(X-M)
to simplify we ignore the government and foreign sector
S(Y) = I(r) 

marginal propensity to consume (MPC) 边际消费倾向
the proportion of additional income spent on consumption
MPC + MPS = 1  MPS marginal propensity to save

IS curve income Y real interest rate,r
IS curve persent an inverse relationship between income and real interest rate

r rise => i down
S down => Y down
r down => i rise
S rise => Y rise

quantity theory of money
MV = PY
M : money supply
V : velocity of money in transaction
P : price level
Y : Real GDP

monetarists consider that velocity of money and reak GDP change only slowly
money neutrality: change of money supply only cause flucuation of price level and 
	doesn't affect real output in long run

Keynes's demand for money theory
Ms / P = Md(r,Y)

transactions demand for money 交易性货币需求
transaction demand rising with larger GDP

Precautionary demand for money 预防性货币需求
precautionary demand rising with larger GDP

speculative demand form money 投机性货币需求
speculative demand rising with lower interest rate

supply of money is determined by the central bank and is not affected by changes in interest rates

LM curve
money demand = money supply
Md(r,Y),increases with the decrease of interest rate and the rise of GDP
positive relationship between income and the real interest rate
Md rising with lower r => Md rising with larger

IS-LM curve
aggregate income = aggregate expenditure
real output and real interest rate

aggregate supply

very short run
	companies increase or decrease output to some degree without changing price
	very short run aggregate supply VSRAS curve is perfectly elastic
long run
	perfectly inelastic
	the level of output as potential GDP 潜在GDP
	full employment GDP 充分就业GDP
	natural rate of unemployment 自然失业率

short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping
profit = TR -TC

factors that shift the aggregate demand
GDP = C + I + G + X - M
price level output
AD

fiscal policy
monetary policy
AD shift to right

capacity utilization 资本利用率 产能利用率
the exchange rate
growth in global economy

factors that shift the short-run aggregate supply
nominal wages
input price , including the price of natural resources
expectations about future output prices and the overall price level
business taxes and subsidies
the exchange rate

recessionary gap, inflationary gap, stagflation
recessionary gap 衰退差
shift AD to the left
real GDP = C + I + G + X - M
actual GDP < Potential GDP
Y2<Y1
Unemployment rate > Natural rate

policy choice
do nothing since there is a self-corecting mechanism
fiscal and monetary policy to shift AD to he right

inflationary gap
actual GDP > potential GDP
unemployment < natural rate

policy choice:
do nothing since there's a self-correcting mechanism
fiscal and monetary policy to shift AD to the left

stagflation
high inflation
unemployment rate > natural rate

economic growth
sources of economic growth
labor supply
human capital
physical capital
technology
natural resources

production function
Y = A f(L,K)
A : total factor productivity 全要素生产率 or technology
L:labor K:capital
growth in potential GDP = growth in technology + Wl(growth in labor) + Wc(growth in capital)
LRAS => Y* shift LRAS curve to the right

output per worker
Y/L = A f(K/L)
Y/L = A f(L/L , K/L) => Y/L = A f(K/L)
growth in potential GDP = growth in technology + Wc(growth in capital-to-labor ratio)

measures of sustainable growth
labor productivity
	the quantity of goods and services that a worker can produce in one hour of work
labor productivity = real GDP / aggregate hours works
proential GDP = aggregate hours worked * labor productivity
protential GDP growth rate = long-tem growth rate    labor force + long-term labor productivity growth

total factor productivity Y=Af(K,L)  A:total factor productivity

Labor productivity can be directly measured as output/hour
