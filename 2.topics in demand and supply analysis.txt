demand , substitution and income effect
替代 normal inferior goods
willingness ability 意愿能力 purchase  good  given price
law of demand : price rise buy less price falls buy more
demand function 
	quantity fo demand
	qxd = f(px,i,py,...)

demand curve
	price 决定了 quantity of demand
	p纵坐标 q横坐标
	q = f(p) demand fucntion
	p = f(q) demand curve function 

consumer surplus
	the difference  between  highest price (on the demand curve)  actual price  utility

substitution effect
income effect
	nominal income  real income real purchasing power
when the price of A decreases, 

normal goods
inferior goods

giffen goods 
	giffen goods are inferior goods
	substitution effect +2
	income effect: -4
	demand decrease as price decreases,demand curve has positive slope
	negative income effect > positive substitution effect
veblen gooods 显示身份地位
	demand increase as price rises, goods are not inferior goods
	demand curve has positive slope

demand elasticity
calculate interpret price income cross-pirce elasticity of demand
	Edpx = % delta Q / % delta P = (delta Q / delta P) * ( P / Q)              slope = delta P / delta Q
	
A(5,10) B(10,5)

Arc method (弧弹性)
average quantity average price

|Ep| = 1 unit elastic
     > 1 elastic
     < 1 inelastic

delta TR % = delta Q % + delta P %
|Ep| = 1
demand elastic , price TR opposite direction
demand inelastic , price TR same direction
prefectly elastic 完全弹性 demand curve is horizontal
prefectly inelastic 

portion of income spent on a good
	the larger the proportion of income spent on a good, the more elastic the demand for that good

availiability and closeness of substitutes

time

income elasticity of demand

EdI = % delta Qdx / % delta I = delta Q / delta I  *  I / Q
normal good  positive income elasticity
inferior good  negative income elasticity

cross-price elasticity of demand
Ed py = % delta Qdx / % delta Py = delta Qdx / delta Py * Py / Qdx

substitutes(替代品): positive cross-price elasticity
complements(互补品): negative cross-price elasticity

Qx = 5 - 1/4Px + 10I + 1/4Py
Px = 4 , I=10 , Py=8
Ep = delta Q % / delta P % = delta Q / delta P * P/Q

Revenue,cost,product
diminishing marginal product
profit
opportunity costs
explicit costs accounting costs
implicit costs
toatal economic cost = explicit costs + implicit costs  total opportunity cost
economic profit
accounting profit = total revenue = accounting costs (explicit costs)
economic profit = total revenue = total economic costs
		= accounting profit = implicit costs
EP = AP - IC 财务利润 决定 经济利润
EP = 0   normal profit 
	the accounting profit that makes economic profit zero
Total revenue 
	TR = P * Q
average revenue
	AR = TR/Q = P*Q / Q = P
mariginal revenue
	one variablity change other changing in value
	MR = delta TR / delta Q = delta (P*Q) /delta Q  
	=P
MR = AR = P 前提,公司没有定价权 pricing power
the relationship between MR and price elasticity
MR = P[1-(1/Ep)]
MR = delta TR / delta Q  TR = P*Q
P = f(Q)
TR = f(Q)*Q
MR = TR'(求导) = delta TR / delta Q = F(Q) + f'(Q)*Q
	=P + delta P/delta Q *Q
Ep = delta Q/delta P * P/Q
	=p - p/Ep = p(1-1/Ep)
Total fixed cost(TFC) sum of all fixed expenses
total variable cost(TVC)
TC
AFC
AVC
ATC
mariginal cost MC 
MC = delta TC /delta Q = delta(TFC + TVC) / delta Q = delta TVC / delta Q
factors of production
	land labor capital materials
labor capital
assume only consider captial and labor
Q=f(K,L)
in the short-run capital is fixed,only consider labor
Q=f(L)

total product TP during a time period
Average product (AP) APl= TP/L  
marginal product (MP)
	MPl = delta TP/ delta L

total product curve  slope= delta TP / delta Ql = MPl

cost analysis in the short and long run
TC(total cost) = TFC(total fixed cost) + TVC(total variable cost)
slope = delta TC/ delta Q = MC

AFC = TFC/Q 

MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimun points

Long-run average cost curve
LRATC

economies of scale (increasing returns to scale)(规模经济)
A firm moves t o lower cost structures when it grows in sizes
reasons:
	division of labor
	being able to afford more-expensive,but more-efficient equipment
	effectively reducing waste and lowering costs
	making better use of market information and knowledge
	discounted price on resources when buying larger quantities

diseconomies of scale (decresing returns to scale)(规模不经济)
A firm becomes less efficient with size.
reasons:
	management inefficiency
	overlap and dupliction of business functions
	higer resource prices due to supply constraints

minimum efficient scale (成本最低有效规模)
the minimun point on the LRATC(long run average total cost)

profit maximization
profit-maximizing level of 
breakeven shutdown
short-run long-run

perfect competition
price taker  the individual firm has virtually no impact on market price
identical products  small seller among a very large number of firms selling essentially
horizontal demand curve   perfect elasticity
P=MR
MR = delta TR / delta Q = delta P*Q / delta Q = p*deltaQ /delta Q = P

imperfect competition
price maker exert some influence over price
downward-sloping demand curve

P=a+bQ
TR = P*Q = aQ + bQ^2
MR = delta TR / delta Q = a + 2bQ

profit maximization
profit = total revenue - tatal cost
the difference between TR and TC is the greatest

垂直距离最大
MR = MC 当边际收入 等于 边际成本，实现利润最大化

profit = TR - TC  => MR-MC =0  => MR = MC

shutdown and breakeven point
AR >= ATC , firm stay in the market AR*Q >= ATC*Q -> TR>TC => TR-TC >=0 (profit)
ATC > AR >= AVC  ATC*Q>AR*Q>=AVC*Q TC>TR>=TVC stay in market in the short run ,but will exit the market in the long run
AR < AVC  AR*Q < AVC*Q  TR<TVC ,firm shut down in th short run and exit the market in the long run

short-run shutdowm point  AR<AVC
long-run shutdown point AR<ATC
breakeven point TR=TC
P=AR=MR=ATC  breakeven

short-run equilibrium
MR=MC=P
