spot exchange rate 即期汇率
	currency exchange rates for immediate delivery
forward exchange rate 远期汇率
	currency exchange rates for an exchange to be done in the future

forward quotation 远期报价
points basis 基点报价
spot rate + 0.0001*points = forward rate (0.01 for Yen)
spot rate GBP/EUR = 0.8552, one month points are -1.1
the one month forward rate
GBP/EUR = 0.8552 + 0.0001*(-1.1) = 0.85509

precentage basis
0.8552 -0.29%
0.8552*(1-0.29%) = 0.85272

interest rate parity 利率平价关系
the percentage diference between forward and spot exchange rates is approximately equal to 
	the difference between the two countries' interest rates
Fforward rate(x/y) /S spot rate(x/y) = 1+rx / 1+ry

F x/y = S x/y * 1+rx/1+ry

x:RMB y:USD Sx/y=6 => 1/6 

1/Sx/y * (1+ry) * Fx/y =>< 1*(1+rx)
左边RMB换美元，美元利息，远期换回RMB，右边RMB本金利息

F-S / S = 1+rx / 1+ry -1 = rx-ry / 1+ry

forward premium and forward discount 远期升水 远期贴水
if the forward quote is higher than spot price
	base currency is trading at a forward premium 远期升水
	price currency is trading at a forward dicount 远期贴水
if the forward quote is less than spot price
	base currency is trading at a forward discount
	price currency is trading at a forward premium

Marshal-Lerner condition 马歇尔-勒纳条件
X-M < D trade deficit
WxEx + Wm(Em-1) > 0
Wx and Wm are the shares of exports and imports
Ex and Em are the price elasticities of demand

either Ex or Em is bigger 1
delta TR % = delta TR / TR = delta P * Q + delta Q * P / P*Q = delta P / P + delta Q /Q = delta P % + delta Q %

The FX rate adjustment has larger impact on trade balance if a country exports and imports
goods for which there are good substitutes

BT = Y - E
balance of trade
BT = X - M = Y - E
