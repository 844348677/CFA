perfect competition
five factors determine market sturcture

characteristics of perfect competition
large number of potential buyers and sellers
virtually identical
few barries to entry and exit
price taker no market pricing power
non-price competition is absent

short-run equilibrium MC = MR=P   demand curve horizontial

short run supply

完全竞争的企业，明确的供应曲线，其他不行，其他有定价权

monopolistic competition
differentiated products
some pricing power

profit maximization input : MC=MR  TR-TC maximizations
P* - ATC 
demand curve individual demand curve not totally
TR = P*Q = aQ + bQ^2
MR = delta TR / delta Q = a + 2bQ

perfect competition demand curve MR curve is samiler

firms are free to entry and exit
demand shift to left
demand curve ATC 
P = ATC

downward-sloping, highly elastic
E = 1/slope * P/Q

monopoly
characteristics of monopoly
single seller
no close substitute
considerable pricing power

type of barriers to entry
government licensing and legal barries
resource control
natural monopoly
ecomomies of scale cost of production is lowest
productiong is based on significant economies of scale and declining cost structures in the market
MC is lower but TFC total fixed cost is higher

MC=MR => Q* demand cure => P* positive economic profit P* > ATC*

D=MB intersect MC 
DWL 

average const pricing : p=ATV , no economic profit
marginal cost pricing : P=MC , government subsidy

price discrimination 价格歧视
charging different consumers different prices for same product or service

perfect price discrimination
first-degree price discrimination
charging each customer the highest price the customer is willing to pay

second-degree price discrimination
monopolist offers a menu of quantity based pricing

oligopoly
characteristics of oligopoly 寡头

kinked demand curve model 拐折需求线模型

Nash equilibrium

collusion

dominant firm DF 主导企业
